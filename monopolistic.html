      <h1>Monopolistic Competition</h1>
      <p>Monopolistic competition is a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical. Examples of markets with this market structure are restaurants, education services, health services, and accommodation services.</p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Freedom of Entry and Exit of Market</li>
        <li>Product Differentiation</li>
        <li>Multiple Firms</li>
        <li>Non-Price Competition</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>In the Short Run:</h2>
      <p>In the short run, a monopolistically competitive firm behaves much like a monopoly. Because each firm sells a differentiated product, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve and maximizes profit by producing the quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, then charging the highest price consumers are willing to pay for that quantity. <br>Depending on whether the resulting price is above or below average total cost, the firm may earn a profit or incur a loss. Thus, in the short run, monopolistic competitors set output and price in the same way as monopolies, and their profitability depends on the relationship between price and average cost.</p>
      <h2>In the Long Run:</h2>
      <p>In the long run, monopolistic competition differs from monopoly because economic profits attract new entrants. As more firms enter with similar but differentiated products, each existing firm’s demand curve shifts left as customers are spread across more competitors. This process continues until any short-run profits are competed away.<br>In the long run, firms produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but the price they can charge falls to the point where it equals average total cost. As a result, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit in the long run, though they still have some market power due to product differentiation.</p>
