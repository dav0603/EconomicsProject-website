      <h2>Monopoly</h2>
      <p><i>A quick overview...</i> <br><br> A monopoly is a market structure in which one firm controls the entire supply of a specific good or service. Since there are no substitutes, they are the only provider. This gives them a lot of control over the price and output of their products in the market.</p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One firm dominates</li>
        <li>No substitutes - unique product</li>
        <li>Monopoly has market power</li>
        <li>High barriers to entry for competitors</li>
        <li>Price makers, not price takers</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How do Monopolies Form</h2>
      <p>This would be due to barriers to entry. There are significant barriers which ultimately cause monopolies.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ownership of a Key Resource</li>
        <p>When a single firm has the exclusive rights to an essential input, it creates a monopoly, since no other company can replicate the good or service without that key resource. The lack of competitors in the market creates a monopoly.  <br><br>Eg. Rare material mining company, like De Beers who for decades had controlled 80-90% of the global diamond supply. They had acquired almost all the diamond mines and in turn created a shortage of this resource.</p>
        <li>Legal Barriers</li>
        <p>Governments can create a monopoly by giving exclusive rights to a company. They can do this through licenses or patents. This regulation put in place makes it almost impossible for other companies to compete. A patent grants and enforces property rights and can be approved when an invention is original. This incentivises companies to invest in research, as they can become sole owners of a product and demand whatever price they please up until the patent expires.</p>
        <li>Natural Barriers</li>
        <p>Natural Monopolies occur when a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than if 2 or more firms were to do it. If new firms attempted to join the market, the start up costs would be too high and it wouldn’t work. It may also be inefficient to have more than one provider of a service.  <br><br>Eg. Public Transport services Irish Rail. </p>
        <li>External Growth</li>
        <p>Dominant firms can continue growing through mergers with smaller companies selling similar products.  <br><br>Eg. Luxottica Eyewear. This one Italian company makes frames and sunglasses for 80% of the eyewear industry. They have acquired established brands such as Rayban and Oakley. By owning these brands, Luxottica benefits from the existing customer base. They have huge influence and control over the market, allowing them to be price makers.   </p>
      </ol>
      <h2>Monopoly Power</h2>
      <p><i>What influence do they have?</i></p>
      <p>Price Setting<br>- They are the price makers<br>They can choose the price and quantity to maximise profits.</p>
      <p>Output Levels<br>- Able to produce less than competitive markets<br>- Leads to higher prices for consumers</p>
      <p>Profits<br>- Long term average profits can be made because there are no competitors entering the market<br>- They can charge above the cost for long periods and people have to pay it because there are no substitutes</p>
      <h2>Advantages of a Monopoly</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows for a stable supply of essential goods</li>
        <li>Economies of scale - lower costs</li>
        <li>Large budgets for research</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Disadvantages of a Monopoly</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher prices</li>
        <li>Limited choice</li>
        <li>Lower output</li>
        <li>Can become inefficient</li>
        <li>Poorer customer service, as there's no competition to keep them accountable</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Are Monopolies Desirable?</h2>
      <p>For Consumers: No - price above marginal costs therefore firm is earning supernormal profits and the consumers are being exploited</p>
      <p>For Firms: Yes - more revenue due to the earning of supernormal profits</p>
      <p>For Society: Depends on whether the firm dominating the market is state owned or regulated or if it aligns with public needs</p>
      <h2>Government Regulation</h2>
      <p>What can governments do to stop monopolies from abusing their power?<br>- Regulate behaviour and prices<br>Water, gas, and electricity companies can't charge whatever<br>- state ownership<br>Turn private natural monopolies into public enterprises<br>- competition<br>Make monopoly industries more competitive, therefore breaking up monopolies. This can be achieved with anti trust laws and legislations to prevent mergers </p>
      <h2>Case Study - Real World Example</h2>
      <p><i><u>Irish Rail:</u></i></p>
      <p>A natural monopoly in the railway industry, since one firm can provide the service more efficiently than several different competing firms could. The key reasons for this are as follows; </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Huge fixed costs – Rail transport needs tracks, stations, trains and signaling systems. The upfront cost involved is very expensive, as well as the maintenance costs associated with upkeeping everything. If two or more companies tried to compete, it would be a waste since they would be duplicating the same infrastructure. Therefore it makes more economic sense to just have one provider. </li>
        <li>Economies of Scale – As Irish Rail carries more passengers, the average cost per person is lowered. Seeing as there are no competitors, costs can be kept low, benefitting both Irish Rail and the consumer, while making transport more efficient.  </li>
        <li>Government Ownership – Irish Rail is a state owned company, meaning the government controls prices, provides subsidies for unprofitable rural lines, ensures safety standards are met and maintains the network. This eliminates the overpricing aspect associated with monopolies. </li>
