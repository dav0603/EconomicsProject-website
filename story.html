      <h1>Market Village - A Short Story</h1>
      <p><i>Below is a short story which explains each of the market structures!</i></p>
      <p>Jack had always wanted to start his own business, but he could never understand how different market structures worked. One day, he traveled to a place nearby called Market Village. This was a place known for having every type of market contained in one location. Jack had hoped that by taking a trip through the town, everything would make sense.
<br><br>
To enter the town, Jack had to pass through Monopoly Mountain. This was a quiet area with only one major business, Rails Railways. This company controlled every train, every track, and owned every station. As Jack observed, he figured out why this is. The cost of building the railway lines, maintaining the trains and tracks, hiring train drivers and staff, and upkeeping safety would be huge. Jack could never afford to compete, and he realised having several companies building railways would make no sense. That’s when it clicked to Jack what a monopoly was. It is one firm, with really high barriers to entry, and a unique product or service. He saw the benefit as a smooth running system which covered the whole country and didn’t waste any resources. He also noticed that the price was higher than he had expected, and that innovation was slow since Rails Railways had no competition pushing them. Jack left Monopoly Mountain with the understanding that monopolies can be efficient, but they need to have regulations in place to protect consumers.
<br><br>
Walking downhill and away from Monopoly Mountain, Jack then entered Oligopoly Square. Jack noted how busy and energetic this place was. It seemed to have a lot of fizzy drink companies. There were factories with a constant flow of trucks going in and out of each. Jack counted four main companies. He noticed that one of the companies brought in a new discount and almost immediately the other companies reacted. Some of them lowered their prices, others advertised new drink flavours and one even launched a loyalty card promotion. It was clear that firms in an oligopoly watch each other closely. No one could stray too far from the others, and each always needed to have an edge to stay relevant amongst the others. Jack noted that there are few large firms with high barriers to entry. They have intense rivalry, similar pricing, and interdependence.
<br><br>
Jack’s last stop was Competition Avenue. It was the liveliest area in Market Village. There were so many different colourful cafes and shops along the road. They all sold similar products, like sandwiches, coffee and snacks, but each business had something unique about it. One played live music, another made sandwiches with homemade bread, one had student discounts and another had a reading nook and had books lining the walls inside. Jack discovered this was monopolistic competition. He recognised that there were many small firms and the barriers to
<br><br>
entry were low. Each business had something different to offer which appealed to and attracted customers. Prices were reasonable in Competition Avenue because so many options existed. But no firm could afford to be lazy as a result. This market was centered around creativity and variety, and the competitive aspect actually encouraged innovation.
<br><br>
On the train home, Jack thought about what he had learned today.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A monopoly was efficient for firms with huge costs, like trains, but it needs to be regulated.</li>
        <li>An Oligopoly was dominated by a few firms who must constantly react to each other</li>
        <li>Monopolistic Competition involves many small businesses who offer variety, innovation, good prices and creativity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jack now had a much better understanding of Market Structures and finally felt ready to start his own business. He decided that monopolistic competition would be best suited for him as a starting entrepreneur.</p>
