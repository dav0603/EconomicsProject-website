      <h1>Oligopoly</h1>
      <p>An oligopoly market is a market structure characterised by a small number of firms that dominate the market. Examples of oligopolies include Ryanair and Air Lingus.</p>
      <h2>Key Features:</h2>
      <p>Few sellers; a small number of firms control the market.
Interdependence; one firms actions effect the other firm&#39;s outcomes, prices and
advertisement.
<br><br>
Price control; all firms have the power to influence prices, leading to price stability or
collusion. Price rigidity is often the case with oligopolies because firms want to avoid
price wars.
<br><br>
Barriers to entry; firms can enter and exit the market freely. Although entering the
market could be quite difficult because of the few firms that dominate it.
<br><br>
Product differentiation; products are often different from other firms' products in
hopes of getting more consumers.</p>
      <h2>Market Competitiveness:</h2>
      <p>The HHI (Herfindahl Hirschman index) is used to measure the markets
competitiveness. HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing
firm in the industry and then summing the resulting numbers</p>
      <h2>Game Theory:</h2>
      <p>Oligopoly is interdependent and because of this people often use the game theory to
understand it.
<br><br>
The prisoner's dilemma is the main one used. It shows how two firms might not
agree and cooperate despite it being the best for both their firms. This can lead to a
worse outcome for both firms.</p>
      <h2>Graph: The Kinked Demand Curve</h2>
      <img src="images/kinkeddemandcurve.png">
      <ul>
        <li>The upper part of the curve (above the kink) is flatter, showing that if the firm increases price, it loses many customers.</li>
        <li>The lower part (below the kink) is steeper, showing that price cuts don’t increase sales much because rivals also lower their prices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the kink point, there is a discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve, meaning that
small cost changes don’t affect the firm’s chosen price. This explains why prices
remain stable in oligopolistic markets because firms try to keep prices the same to
avoid losing profit and market share.
<br><br>
Efficiency; oligopolies are not efficient because prices exceed marginal cost, creating
deadweight loss. They are less efficient than perfect competition but more efficient
than monopoly.
<br><br>
Innovation; high profits fund the research and development leading to technological
progress.
<br><br>
Consumer impact; the consumers benefit from product variety but often face higher
prices.</p>
      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p><u>Aer Lingus:</u></p>
      <p>Aer Lingus is part of an oligopoly because only a small number of airlines dominate
the Irish market. High barriers to entry, like airport slots, limit new competitors. Their
pricing and strategic decisions are interdependent, meaning each airline must react
to their competitors moves.</p>
      <p><u>Interdependence:</u></p>
      <p>When Ryanair reduces fares on a competitive route. Aer Lingus
frequently follows to avoid losing market share. For instance, during intense fare
competition on routes such as Dublin to London. Both airlines engaged in fare
matching and promotional offers. This demonstrates interdependence, a key
characteristic of oligopolies; each firm must anticipate the likely reaction of the other
before making strategic decisions.</p>
      <p><u>Barriers to Entry:</u></p>
      <p>Both airlines compete for valuable take off and landing slots at key
airports, like Dublin airport. Control over slots allows airlines to dominate high
demand routes and schedule flights at peak times. As a key airline, Aer Lingus
benefits from long held slot allocations, while Ryanair tries to expand its presence
through negotiations and competitive pressure. This struggle reflects the barriers to
entry and strategic control typical of oligopolistic markets.</p>
      <p><u>Consumer Impact</u></p>
      <p>The rivalry between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has led to lower
fares, frequent flights, and broader route networks for passengers. However, the
limited number of major competitors raises concerns about potential impact
collusion, reduced innovation, and coordinated pricing in the long run. Thus, the Aer
Lingus case shows both the benefits and risks of oligopolistic competition for
consumers.</p>
